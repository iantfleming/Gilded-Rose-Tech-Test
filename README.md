## Gilded-Rose-Tech-Test

```
I am aware that there is still quite a lot to be done. I have refactored much of the code,
but have run into issues that might suggest some of my tests aren't doing quite what
I expect though I'm not sure. I also haven't tested the new methods I created
and I'm not sure if I should as they are just written as short hand
for conditions to be used in the main update_quality method.
I don't know if I would be able to get any further than where I am currently without some help.

Overall, this is a clearer example of where my coding abilities are as
I haven't looked very much at other people's code.
